Moreover, a nuanced analysis of crime statistics proves instrumental in identifying and addressing emerging crime problems, fostering a proactive and adaptable approach to maintaining public safety.\n",

    "- Overall crime rates seem to be going down in Scotland.\n",
    "- Some areas with lower crime rates have shown an increase in overall crime rates last year (e.g., Orkney, Shetlands and Outer-Hebrides).\n",

    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several limitations to these analyses, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The high-dimensionality of the data: As the number of dimensions increases, a distance-based similarity measure converges to a constant value between any given examples. I could've potentially addressed this by using a dimensionality reduction technique (such as principal component analysis).\n",
    "- The random initialization of k being dependent on the initial values.\n",
    "- Highly impacted by outliers.\n",
    "- Always tried to find circular clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some possible follow-up questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can we predict specific crime types for each county?\n",
    "- Why aren't the isles clustered within cluster 1?\n",
    "- Why do some counties show high crime rate levels of one type of crime, but not others (e.g., Shetlands have high drugs possession crime rates, but overall low crime)?\n",
    "- Can we reduce dimensionality of data before clustering?\n",
    "- Is there a better algorithm other than K-means to capture non-spherical clusters?\n",
    "- Even though crime rates are calculated per capita, what is the effect of different population densities in each county?"
